We always go to the chevo's in chandler which is delicious, the one in ahwatukee is different for some reason.  Ordered the <chicken rolled tacos/> today there was a tiny lil piece of <chicken/> in each one, so basically I had 3 rolled <deep fried tortillas/> yuck! :( No flavor what so ever.  Also ordered <carne asada taco/> the <meat/> tasted old like it was cooked earlier and just thrown on the grill to get warm.  Very dissapointed!!
