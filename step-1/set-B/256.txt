Just by having <queso fundido/> with <chorizo/> on the menu T&T was off to a great start. It was pretty solid <queso/> too.

Then to my surprise I found another of my Mexican favorites, <street corn/>.  It was great.  It had a lot of flavor.

This is a good place to get some decent Mexican in Las Vegas.
