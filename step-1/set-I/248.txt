This is a decent very casual lunch spot.  The <chips and salsa/> are solid.  We opted to add <queso/> for more flavor.  The <queso/> has good flavor.

We split an order of <steak nachos/>.  They are prepared differently than most <nachos/>.  There are four large <chips/> with toppings stacked high on them.  The <chips/> have quite a bit of <steak/> on them.  They have ok flavor.  Not bad, but not a lot either.

They have an assortment of your standard drinks found at most Mexican joints.  The prices are inline with other casual casino options.
