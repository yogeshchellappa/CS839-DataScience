This is a newer location of the breakfast\/brunch chain Eggsmart. It has the same, basic, breakfast foods and nice, big breakfast combos. We started going to this location a few months back when we realized it was open and go every once and awhile. We've always had pretty consistent service and the food as been as good as one expects from this type of place. I usually get their two <eggs/> combo with <bacon/> and <toast/> and I like it because it's basic. Prices are pretty good (although your non-chain greasy spoon will likely have comparable for cheaper). Today I had the <spinach/> and <cheese omelet/> and wasn't a fan. Too much <feta/> was rolled up in the <omelet/> and it was all your could taste. Will go with my basic again next time.
